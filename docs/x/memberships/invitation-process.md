# Invitation process
The invitation process is the first su-process of the accreditation procedure. 
which allows you to invite a new user to join Commercio.network so that you can later be rewarded if he later
buys a membership.  

## Requirements
Suppose that you want to invite another user and later receive a reward once he buys a membership. 
Then, the following requirements must be met:

* You must already have [bought](tx/buy-membership.md) a membership. 
* You must know the user's identity that he has created by following the [specific guide](../id/tx/create-an-identity.md).

## Inviting a user
Once all the [above requirements](#requirements) have been met, you can invite the user by performing an
[invitation transaction](tx/inviting-user.md). 

Once done, you will be automatically rewarded when the user buys a new membership.
