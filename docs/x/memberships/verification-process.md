# Verification process
The verification process allows any Trusted Service Provider (*TSP*) to mark a user as being already verified.  
This procedure needs to be followed in order to allow any user to buy a membership and is the second sub-process 
(along with the [invitation one](invitation-process.md)) to be part of the accreditation procedure.

## Verifying a user
:::warning  
In order to mark a user as being properly verified, **you must be a TSP**.    
If you wish to become one please ask the government to elect you.   
:::

To properly verify a user you must perform a [verification transaction](./tx/verify-user.md).
