# Memberships 
Inside Commercio.network we've designed a system to make sure that the network that will be build is made
of trusted participants.

To do so we've implemented a *membership* system which allows you to buy a membership (represented by an *NFT token*) 
to display to everyone that you've been invited by an already verified members to join the network. 

## Buying a membership
Memberships can be bought **exclusively on chain**. 
To do so you are required to possess an amount of Commercio Cash Credits (*CCC*) greater or 
equals to price of the membership you wish to buy.  

### Requirements
In order to buy a membership, the following requirements must be met: 

1. You must have been invited by a user already having a Bronze membership or superior.  
   Please refer to the [invitation procedure page](../memberships/invitation-process.md) 
   to know more about invitations. 
2. You must have been verified by a Trusted Service Provider.  
   Please refer to the [verification procedure](../memberships/verification-process.md)
   to know more about the verification process.
3. You must possess a sufficient amount of CCCs to buy a membership.  
   Please refer to the [proper page](../mint/README.md) to know more about how to get CCCs out of your Commercio Tokens.
   
### Buying process
Once you've met all the [requirements](#requirements), you can buy a membership by 
performing a [buying transaction](./tx/buy-membership.md).  
After doing so, you will be able to verify your membership status 
using the [membership query feature](./query/current-membership.md).  

## Membership types
The currently supported memberships and their prices are the following.
