# Bank
The `bank` module allows you to send any token amount you possess to any other user inside the Commercio.network chain. 

## Sending tokens
In order to send a token, you must perform a [send transaction](./tx/send.md).

:::warning    
Please note that you might not be able to perform this transaction if you are marked as a blocked account.  
To know more about blocked accounts, please refer to the [proper page](./blocked-accounts.md).
