# CommercioDOCS
CommercioDOCS is the module that allows you to send a document to another user, and retrieve the list of documents
that you have received. 

{:toc}

## Sharing a document
In order to send a document you are required to have an identity with some tokens inside it.   
In order to know what an identity is, how to create it and how to get tokens, please refer to the 
[*"Creating an identity"* section](commercioid.md#creating-an-identity).  

### Using the CLI 
In order to send a document using the CLI you can use the following command 

```shell
cncli tx commerciodocs share \
  [recipient] \
  [document-uuid] \ 
  [document-metadata-uri] \
  [metadata-schema-uri] \
  [metadata-schema-version] \
  [metadata-verification-proof] \
  [document-content-uri] \
  [checksum-value] \
  [checksum-algorithm]
```

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |  
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: | :---------- |
| `recipient` |  String | Yes | Bech32 address of the document recipient | 
| `document-uuid` | String | Yes | UUID of the document that is being sent |
| `document-metadata-uri` | String | Yes | Uri to the file containing the document metadata |
| `metadata-schema-uri` | String | Yes | Uri to the file containing the definition of the metadata schema used to define the metadata of this document |
| `metadata-schema-version` | String | Yes | Version of the schema used to define the document's metadata |
| `metadata-verification-proof` | String | Yes | Proof that the client has correctly verified the validity of the metadata based on the associated schema |
| `document-content-uri` | String | No | Uri of the file containing the document's data |
| `checksum-value` | String | Yes if `document-content-uri` is present | Value of the document content's checksum | 
| `checksum-algorithm` | String | Yes if `checksum-value` is present | Algorithm used to compute the document's content checksum |

#### Example usage 

```shell
cncli tx commerciodocs share \
  did:com:1d63vn76znf6fxumfdgx4rmc4wlnppv5evqnx84 \
  490e835d-dbb3-445c-aedc-df477f41d8a2 \

```

### Creating a transaction offline
In order to properly send a `commerciodocs/SendDocument` transaction, you will need to create and sign the
following message:

```json
{
  "sender": "<Your address>",
  "recipient": "<Recipient address>",
  "uuid": "<Document UUID>",
  "content_uri": "<Document content URI>",
  "metadata": {
    "content_uri": "<Metadata content URI>",
    "schema": {
      "uri": "<Metadata schema URI>",
      "version": "<Metadata schema version>"
    },
    "proof": "<Metadata validation proof>"
  },
  "checksum": {
    "value": "<Document content checksum value>",
    "algorithm": "<Checsum algorithm>"
  }
}
```

### Supported checksum algorithm
When computing the checksum of a document's contents, you must use one of the following supported checksum algorithms.  
Not using one of these will result in your transaction being rejected or mishandled by recipients. 

| Algorithm | Specification |
| :-------: | :-----------: |
| `md5` | [MD5](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt) |
| `sha-1`| [SHA-1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174) |
| `sha-224` | [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634) |
| `sha-256` | [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634) |
| `sha-384` | [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634) |
| `sha-512` | [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634) |

#### Checksum validity check
Please note that, when sending a document that has an associated checksum, the validity of the checksum itself is
checked only formally. This means that we only check that the hash value has a valid length, but we do not check 
if the given has is indeed the hash of the document's content. It should be the client responsibility to perform this 
check.  

## [WIP] Sending a document reading receipt
Once you have received a document and you want to acknowledge the sender that you have properly read it, you can use 
the `SendDocumentReceipt` transaction that allows you to do that. 

### Using the CLI
In order to send such a transaction using the CLI, you can execute the following command:

```shell
cncli tx commerciodocs send-document-receipt \
  [document-sender] \
  [document-recipient] \ 
  [tx-hash] \
  [document-uuid] \
  [proof]
```

#### Parameters 
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |  
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: | :---------- |
| `document-sender` | Address | Yes | The address of the original document sender | 
| `document-recipient` | Address | Yes | The address of the original document recipient |
| `tx-hash` | String | Yes | Hash of the transaction inside which is contained the sent document |
| `document-uuid` | Uuid | Yes | UUID of the document to which this receipt is related to |
| `proof` | String | No | Optional proof that the recipient has read the document | 

#### Example usage 
```shell
cncli tx commerciodocs send-document \
  [document-sender] \
  [document-recipient] \ 
  [tx-hash] \
  [document-uuid] \
  [proof]
```

### Creating a transaction offline
In order to properly create and send a transaction representing a document receipt you need to compose the 
`commerciodocs/SendDocumentReceipt` message:

```json
{
  "sender": "<Document sender address>",
  "recipient": "<Document recipient address>",
  "tx_hash": "<Tx hash in which the document has been sent>",
  "document_uuid": "<Document UUID>",
  "proof": "<Optional reading proof>"
}
```
